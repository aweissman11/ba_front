export const hisStory = `It was quite a Friday. That afternoon, while delivering ice cream for Toscanini's, I got the call from EF offering me a job as an Educational Tour Consultant. It was to be my first real job, so I was, understandably, pretty pumped up about it. I hit up Nina and said "let's celebrate!". That night, she was hanging out with Helen, a friend of hers and a fellow Rindge grad, and she invited me to tag along. I guess Helen reached out to her friend, Jen Bogle, who brought along her roommate. So the five of us started the night at Miracle of Science, a bar located in the sweet sweet Coast (Central Square, Cambridge for the uninitiated). We were having some drinks and I guess I just couldn't bring myself to leave the roommate alone. What can I say? I was in a good mood and thought this girl was pretty cute. I started chatting her up and thought we were vibing, but suddenly, the bartender started offering her FREE DRINKS! Needless to say, I knew I had to get us all out of there before someone else swooped in. So I gathered the other girls and offered up something I knew no one would be able to resist: free ice cream. We were gonna head to this house party across town anyway and didn't have any beers so I said, “let's just bring some ice cream!” Given my new job offer, I figured the free ice cream hookup wouldn't last forever anyway. So, just as this roommate lady got offered a brand new, full to the brim, free beer from the bartender, we dragged her out of the bar and headed over to Toscis. There, we grabbed a few pints of heavenly Nocciola bliss, among other flavors, before heading over to what is now dubbed the "moon and stars party" in North Cambridge. After arriving at the party, I spent the rest of the evening haranguing this cute roommate of Jen's, busting moves and doing everything I could to make her laugh. We had a bit of a connection, especially when talking about biking around the city going full speed on our road bikes. There was a brief tense moment when she found out I didn't typically wear a helmet, but I thought she seemed pretty great. As the night wore on, I knew I had to ask for her phone number, but wanted to find the right moment when we weren't surrounded by everyone else. Then, suddenly, Jen came by and said "our ride is here," and the two of them hightailed it outta there! I was stunned and upset at myself for missing my chance. I left the party a little while later, having enjoyed myself, but ultimately disappointed that I hadn't gotten this girl's number. The next day though, I had a thought. Since Nina knows Helen, and Helen knows Jen, and Jen lives with this girl, maybe I could track down her number. So I hit up Nina and asked if she thought she could give it a shot. Nina texted Helen, who reached out to Jen who asked her roommate. I guess she said it was ok to pass along her number, so Jen sent it to Helen who sent it over to Nina who sent it over to me! I was pumped, but the hard part was yet to come. I still had to craft the ultimate opening text in order to both capture the fun we'd had the night before and get this girl on board with going out for drinks with me. I pained over the task, running through idea after idea, until I realized what leverage I had. So I sent her a text promising to always wear my helmet from now until forever if she'd agree to go out for a few drinks with me. Little did I realize what I'd started as the initial response was just a photo of a bloody face with the caption: "This is what happens when you don't wear your helmet!" I was sure I'd made a huge mistake. But, holding onto that feeling from the night before, I pushed on, and we agreed to grab dinner and drinks at East Coast Grill the following Thursday. The roommate's name is Chelsey and the story of the first date will have to wait for another time.

export const herStory = `I met this kid who worked at an ice cream shop and lived with his parents, and he wouldn’t leave me alone….. in a good sort of way.  Our first three dates happened all in one week.  In spite of every curve ball I threw his direction, he was unfaltering.  When I made him eat hell bones at East Coast Grill, he took me out dancing to the Cantab Lounge. When I took him to a dentist party, he showed up with wine.  When my crazy end-of-the-world enthusiast boss invited coworkers up to his bunker/cabin in New Hampshire for Halloween, Aaron brought his pup Delilah.  I distinctly remember, after each date, he would ask what I was up to the next night. Even if I already had plans, he started to become a part of them all.  Pretty soon, he was joining me at the docks on the Charles to watch the sun set, my favorite post-work stop on my bike ride home from work.  Of course, he brought home-made sandwiches and beers.  This guy was genuine, and so easy to be around.  Pretty soon, his enthusiasm and positivity slowly got the best of me, and here we are now.`;
